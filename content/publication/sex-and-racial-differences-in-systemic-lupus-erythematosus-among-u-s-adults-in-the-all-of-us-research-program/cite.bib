abstract = {Objective Men with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are an understudied population. The present study characterized differences between men and women with SLE. Methods We examined cross-sectionally participants with SLE in the All of Us Research Program, a US cohort with a participant survey at enrollment (May 2018 to June 2022) and linked electronic health record (EHR) data. We described and compared characteristics of men and women with SLE encompassing disease manifestations and prescribed medications from EHR data and socioeconomic factors, including health literacy and health care access and utilization, from surveys. We reported racial variations stratified by sex. Results Of 1,462 participants with SLE, 126 (9\%) were male. Men reported lower educational attainment and less fatigue than women. Myocardial infarction was significantly more common in men. Men had significantly less confidence in completing medical forms than women and exhibited a trend toward requiring more help in reading health-related materials. Barriers to health care access and utilization were common in both men and women (40\% versus 47\%, respectively, reporting some reason for delay in care; P = 0.35). Women of race other than Black or African American or White more often reported delaying care due to cultural differences between patient and provider. Conclusion Our study demonstrated major clinical and health literacy differences in men and women with SLE. Socioeconomic factors were significant barriers to health care in both sexes. Our study suggests men have disproportionately poorer health literacy, which may exacerbate preexisting disparities. Further large prospective studies, focusing on recruiting men, are needed to better characterize racial differences in men with SLE.},
